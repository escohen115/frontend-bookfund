# bookFund

bookFund is a web application where users can sponsor or receive copies of books they’re interested in reading. 
The purpose behind the app is to twofold: 
1. Empower and enable individuals from lower economic backgrounds with the opportunity to read books sponsored by others. 
2. Provide a platform where users can generate positive impact by sponsoring books they've found to be meaningful or inspiring.
  

## Installation

```bash
npm start
```

## Usage

Please note that the current API for this app is hosted by Heroku and load times for an initial request can be roughly 20 seconds.

1. Begin by signing up for an account.
2. You now can sponsor books for others or join a waitlist for a book yourself
3. Search for a book you want to read or sponsor (the homepage can refer you to popular books). 
4. After clicking on the link to a book page, you will be able join the waitlist, leave a comment or rating, or sponsor the book.
5. After joining the waitlist for a book, you can optionally create another account to "sponsor" the book to yourself. 
6. Now, log in with your original account and navigate to your userpage. There you will see a message asking you to leave a review on the book you've received, as well as a countdown timer until you're eligible to receive your next book.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
